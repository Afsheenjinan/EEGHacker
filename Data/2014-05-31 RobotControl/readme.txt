I controlled a Hex Bug with my brain waves.

I used an OpenBCI V1 board with my Processing GUI (blinkyLights variant).  I attached the ref (SRB1) to my left ear lobe, chan 2 to the left-back of my head (O1), and the bias electrode to my right ear lobe.  Electrode impedance for chan 2 was about 50 kOhm.

For stimuli, I did eyes-closed Alpha (move robot forward) and I played a blinking movie (15Hz toggle on left, 10 Hz toggle on right).
